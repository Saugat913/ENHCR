    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <h2>Developing an Interpretable Nepali Handwritten Character Recognizer</h2>

    This project was driven by the desire to create a robust and informative character recognition system for the Nepali
    language. We believe that understanding how models make decisions is crucial for building trust and transparency,
    especially in culturally significant domains like handwriting recognition.
