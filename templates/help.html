    <h2>Welcome to the Nepali Handwritten Character Recognizer!</h2>

    This application uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize handwritten Nepali characters and provides
    interpretability through an integrated gradient algorithm. The algorithm highlights pixels that contribute most to
    the predicted character, offering insights into the model's decision-making process.

    <h3>Getting Started</h3>

    1. Upload a clear image of a handwritten Nepali character in supported formats (e.g., PNG, JPEG).
    2. Click the "Recognize" button.
    3. The recognized character will be displayed, along with a visualization of the pixels that influenced the
    prediction.

    <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

    - If the recognition is incorrect, try uploading a clearer image or using a different font style.
    - If you encounter technical issues, please contact us at [support email address].

    <h3>FAQ</h3>

    * **What character sets are supported?** Currently, the model recognizes all basic Nepali characters (क्ष, त्र, ज्ञ,
    etc.).
    * **How accurate is the recognition?** The accuracy rate is [accuracy percentage] on a standard test dataset.
    * **Will you add support for more features?** We are actively working on improving the model and adding new
    features. Stay tuned for updates!
